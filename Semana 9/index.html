                    <h3>Mohsen Emadi, Iran</h3>
    			    <p>Losses, <br />
    			    Not in our nature <br />
    			    But in our human intention, <br />
    			    Happen. 
    			    However, the body enjoys <br />
    			    Kissing you or her,
    			    the invention of the human being<br />
    			    might have been a mistake.
    			    Snow falls without reason <br />
    			    and the poem written by the human intention<br />does not heal.
    			    Kiss me!</p></div>`;

    		        <h3>Khaled Mattawa, Libya</h3>
    			    <p> The radio blares &quot;Dialogue of Souls,&quot;<br />and the woman who hated clouds<br /> watches the sky.<br />
    			    Where is the sea now? she asks.<br /> Where is it from here?<br /> What is its name?<br />this rain on a morning ride to school,<br />winter, my seventh year,<br />
                    my father driving through rain,<br /> his eyes fixed on a world<br /> of credit and debt.<br />On the radio, devotion <br /> to the lifter of harm <br />from those who despair,<br /> knower of secrets <br />with the knowledge of certainty.</p></div>`;

    			    <p>My country is handed over from one tyrant to the next,<br /> a worse tyrant; from one prison to another,<br /> from one exile to another.<br /> It is colonised by the observed<br /> invader and the hidden one;<br /> handed over by one beast to two<br /> like an emaciated camel.<br /> In the caverns of its death<br />my country neither dies<br /> nor recovers. It digs<br /> in the muted graves looking<br /> for its pure origins<br /> for its springtime promise<br /> that slept behind its eyes<br />for the dream that will come<br /> for the phantom that hid.<br /> It moves from one overwhelming<br /> night to a darker night.<br /> My country grieves<br /> in its own boundaries<br /> and in other people's land<br /> and even on its own soil<br /> suffers the alienation<br /> of exile. </p></div>`;

<div class="doll"><h2>Amber Doll</h2>
    		        <h3>Ladan Osman. Somalia</h3>
    			    <p>I gutted you ten years ago, cut your limbs with a kitchen knife<br />
and threw you in a dumpster across the street.<br />
I watched the three-legged cat grieve you, head in his paws.<br />

Amber, you dull-eyed monster, how did you find me?<br />

You did not scream when I sliced the seam of your spine.<br />
You stared. You smiled your dry-lip smile.<br />
It was not me who colored you purple.<br />
I did not keep you under the stairs.<br />

But we never put rollers in your hair.<br />
You were not even good enough for Brown Bear,<br />
who the Paper Dolls would not give the time of day.<br />
We could have let you marry him.<br />

You are an ugly girl in a paisley dress got from a bin at the Salvation Army.<br />
Your eyes roll white in their sockets, even though you&apos;re cheap<br />
and your eyes don&apos;t move when you&apos;re made to dance,<br />
when a little sister is playing baby and rocking you in her arms.<br /></p></div>`;

    		        <h3>Adonis, Syria</h3>
    			    <p>Bells on our eyelashes <br />
and the death throes of words,<br />
and I among fields of speech,<br />
a knight on a horse made of dirt.<br />
My lungs are my poetry, my eyes a book,<br />
and I, under the skin of words,<br />
on the beaming banks of foam,<br />
a poet who sang  and died<br />
leaving this singed elegy<br />
before the faces of poets,<br />
for birds at the edge of sky.</p></div>`;

<div class="gnats"><h2>Gnats</h2>
    		        <h3>Ladan Osman. Somalia</h3>
    			    <p>I can&apos;t tell why I think the dried corncobs<br />
in the gravel and the mattress under the tree<br />
were not put here by children who bite so fast<br />
they leave rows of kernels.<br />

What does this mattress make me imagine?<br />
What stalks this strange field? Who is eating my head?<br />

Years ago, I would have imagined children jumping<br />
off the branches, landing hard on the mattress,<br />
shouting out when the odd spring caught a rib, an elbow.<br />
There would be a young mother with a plate of corn,<br />
red-faced from the heat and laughing.<br />

Then, bird songs were not ominous.<br />
Danger did not orbit like a gang of gnats.</p></div>`;

<div class="fields"><h2>The Woman in the Fields</h2>
    		        <h3>Ladan Osman. Somalia</h3>

hold out batteries and say, put your tongue on them. Try it, try<br />
while a woman looks on with milky eyes,<br />
her hair husks in boiling water.</p></div>`;
